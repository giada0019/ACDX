# ACDX
A mod that aims to make quality of life improvements, but based and built off of the ACDX by @Cuyler36 and will add 300+ clothing items, 60 new wallpapers, 40 new floors, and so much more! (This could not have been possible without Cuyler's mod, but I am not working with him, ACSE, ACDX, and almost everything is his, do not steal!)
If you plan to redistribute, please do use my credit! I am a single person working on this, also here are some features and info.
Will be based around ACDX V16.2, but will port to newer version when can.
Will have references to City Folk.
Make an "Island Editor" thing for the GBA connectivity, only allowing moving objects.
Add "Tortimer's Island", based off of the Super Smash Bros. series's adaptation of so, with it being a large house.
Will change title theme music, will be changable in settings though!
House price at boot will be 19,999 bells.
Appearance changer for face if special mirror is placed.
And more!
